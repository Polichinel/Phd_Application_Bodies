\section{Motivation and background} 
%Cover Letter detailing your motivation and background for applying for the specific PhD project

% "Are you the right candidate? Preferred applicants will have an interest in questions related to conflict, gender, images, photojournalism and quantitative methodologies. We are looking for candidates with strong analytical skills and proven quantitative methodological qualifications. Experience in working with the Georeferenced Event Dataset from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program or similar datasets is an advantage but not a requirement."

%2)We are looking for candidates with strong analytical skills and proven quantitative methodological qualifications.

% Why you apply for this?
My motivation for applying for this scholarships is multifaceted. First of all, conflict research has been my prime politological subject of interest since even before I started my bachelor and it have been one of two focal point doing both my Bachlor's and Master's program. Secondly, my other prime interest have been advanced quantitative and computational methods. Indeed it is the intersection between computational methods and conflict studies which have been the fulcrum of throughout my masters program as well as the topic of my master thesis. Third, I believe the power to control women's bodies to be a central -- if not the most central -- part of any conflict. As such I see great potential in pursuing a gender focused approach in conflict studies. Fourth, I have long wanted to use image data in my research but I have yet been unable to find data of much relevance -- until you presented this project that is. As such my interest aligns remarkably well with the subject and methods of this project.\par

% What have you done before?
Appropriately my interests are matched by both my abilities and ambitions. Regarding politological subjects I have worked extensively with intra-state conflicts, civil wars and democratic breakdowns and I also have experience with theories on peace-building and post-conflict reconciliation. Concerning quantitative subjects I have worked with Frequentist econometric, Bayesian statistics, Machine/Deep Learning, geo-spatial analysis, panel data, web-scraping, automated text analysis, Social Network Analysis, data visualization and Data Science in general. I have acquired these skills through courses from the Department of Political Science (UCPH), the Department of Economics (UCPH), SODAS (UCPH) and the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (DTU) - along with countless hours spend online, looking for better solutions, more knowledge and new skills. As such, both my theoretical, analytically and methodological foundations are well suited for your project.\par % More pol or less quant? 

% more specifically assignment and master thesis
As an exemple I have written both my master's thesis \citep{SPECIALE} and a free-assignment \citep{Maase} specifically on the subjects of advanced quantitative methods, geo-spatial data and conflict studies. In \citep{Maase} I .... In the thesis \citep{SPECIALE} I...  As such I am confident that I can handle the challenges of your project and bring to the effort both relevant insights and experience.\par% er det godt med brede her over eller skal der kun være ting du ved er relvant for opslaget?

% Bridge
Indeed, given the focus of your focus and your data I see a near-perfect fit between your project on one side and my interest, knowledge and abilities on the other. In the next section I will present a project description outlining my vision of the specific sub-project concerning the correlation between violence in armed conflict and the representation of gender in war photography.\par

% This project; How are you gonna do it (new/better)? ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
% so you are gonna do better?
Using the data set containing war photos available for the project in tandem with modern computational methods we can start answering such questions.

% overall RC
As formulated in the Phd scholarship annoncement, the overarching research question for the specific sub-project is whether there
"[...] a correlation between the level of violence in armed conflict and the representation of gender in war photography?" (ref Fra opslag)

% More speicifically
The literature suggests that more violence leads more traditional gender norms (ref. from Lenes app.). Unfortunately we can not deduced the actually genders norms and roles, but we can deduced how genders are portrait and represented in war photography.

% How?
We have good data. What we need now is precise hypothesis with clear theoretical underpinnings and a appropriate and corresponding methodological framework....

% What do you mean by "precise hypothesis"?
... Cederman et al. siger noget?

% tree cat of photos
but we also have other hypothesis to test; is there any difference between the pictures taken, the pictures send to editing and the pictures published in papers? (what would you expect). Would you expect the publisher to be more prone to fall into stereotypical gender representations then the photographers? Maybe no H, but just but it op as a research area...

% The different genders of the photografers
Furthermore since we have tree male photographers and three female photographers we can also examine. 

% What do you mean by " appropriate and corresponding methodological framework."?
Having these hypothesis we still need to create a methodological framework which will help answer these hypothesis in a theoretical appropriate way.

% Coding of the data
....

% Image recognition
Could perhaps be used, at least we need to try does requirer that we code + 100.000 pictures.

% Agrregation
Using event data such a the data from UCDP is goe-coded for specific coordinates and timestamped for specific time -- with more or less precision. So are the photos (skriv toæ Johan). Naturally these specific coordinates needs to be aggregated into some unite of analysis. Conventional conflict studies have often used country years, but naturally this is much to crude for the project at hand. I purpose a spatial aggregation at the level of the PRIO GRID. (0.5x0.5 decimal degrees). and a temporal aggregation at (mothly?) level. This will give us a unit of analysis consiting of one grid cell one specific month/week. 

% limits of disaggregation
Something about the computational burden of much disaggragation... An that the data can get to sparse..

% Spatial and temporal auto corrolation: GP's
The problem with arbitrary aggregation and for that matter autocorrolation leads to GP's!


% Evaluation -> out-of-sample predicitons/LOO
However, it is not only the estimation framework which is important; so is the evaluation. Out-of-sample prediction or eqavelent is the way forward (greenhill, McEldrith, Shcordt ect) and good arguments.

% "The project: “Bodies as Battleground: Gender Images and International Security” addresses three themes: gender, security and images. The project starts from a discursive conception of security, an understanding of gender as cultural, and the image as open to multiple interpretations. The overall research question of the project is: "How are gender-specific security problems constituted through images?" The project employs a mixed-method strategy and is organized around four sub-projects. These show the importance of historical context for how gender security problems might be shown, the relationship between levels of violence and gender representation in war photography, the way gender norms are reproduced or challenge in photographic images, and the possibilities of images to bring theoretical attention to "invisible" security problems."

% The following criteria are used when shortlisting candidates for assessment:

% 1. Research qualifications as reflected in the project proposal.
% 2. Quality and feasibility of the project.
% 3. Qualifications and knowledge in relevant social science disciplines.
% 4. Performance (grades obtained) in graduate and post-graduate studies.
